# RFC1918 - IP Addresses Reserved for private use

The valid ranges for RFC 1918 private IP addresses are:
* Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
* Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
* Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 

These ranges are reserved for private networks, such as home or office networks, and are not allowed to be used on the public internet. They are not globally unique and can be reused in multiple private networks without causing conflicts. 

RFC 1918, or Request for Comment 1918, is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) memorandum that provides methods for assigning private IP addresses on TCP/IP networks. It was created as a stopgap solution to prevent the exhaustion of public IP addresses before the adoption of IPV6.
