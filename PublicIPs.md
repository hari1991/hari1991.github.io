A valid public IP address is a globally unique IP address that falls within a predefined range and meets certain criteria: 
1. Range: A valid public IP address is within one of the following ranges: 
    ```
    1.0.0.0–9.255.255.255 
    11.0.0.0–126.255.255.255 
    129.0.0.0–169.253.255.255 
    169.255.0.0–172.15.255.255 
    172.32.0.0–191.0.1.255 
    192.0.3.0–192.88.98.255 
    192.88.100.0–192.167.255.255 
    192.169.0.0–198.17.255.255 
    198.20.0.0–223.255.255.255
    ```
2. Format: A valid IP address has four numbers separated by periods. 
3. Number ranges: Each number in a valid IP address must be between 0 and 255. 
4. Reserved addresses: A valid IP address does not use addresses reserved for special purposes. 
5. Network uniqueness: A valid IP address does not conflict with other IP addresses on the same network.

A public IP address is used to identify a device on the internet, while a private IP address is used to connect devices within a local network. 

Any IP address that is not in a private IP address range is considered public. There are many more public IP addresses than private ones because each network on the internet needs a unique public IP. 

An internet service provider (ISP) assigns a public IP address to a network router. Public IP addresses are used for:
Connecting to the internet from inside a network to outside it
Identifying a device to the wider internet 

A public IP address can be traced back to an ISP, which may reveal the device's general geographical location. To browse the internet more anonymously, a user can hide their IP address by using a security protocol like a VPN, proxy server, or the Tor browser. 

You can use a service like myip.com to check if your IP address is public.
